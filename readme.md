# To Do

- Force cursor to switch states (when hovering text/links, for example)
- Add gradients to waybar, gwn-dock, and gwn-drawer if possible
- Update ~/.config/gtk-4.0/*.css to match NixOS path for gtk themes (it's importing as if it were ubuntu)
    - Nautilus is affected by this
- Set f11 to toggle fullscreen (for all windows)
- Set sddm theme
- Set hyprlock theme
- Get open-tablet-drivers to support my tablet
- Install user software:
    - Krita
    - Obsidian
    - Inkscape
    - Godot
    - dotnet
- Find DE software:
    - Process/System Monitor
- Enable dynamic linking (Double check No Boilerplate's video for this)
