# To Do

- Set sddm theme
- Set hyprlock theme
- Certain applications (Steam, Krita) do not respect cursor theme
- Drag and Drop does not function
- Discord file picker portal uses Nautilus despite Nemo being the only file browser installed
- Open Tablet Driver can't change window focus in Artist Mode
    - Check vanilla drivers for window behavior: I know pressure works on vanilla drivers, you just can't change the screen size/target area.
